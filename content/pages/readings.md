The purpose of the **CHEMATLAS** (**_C_**_omprising **H**andy **E**xtra **M**aterials: **A**ll **T**he **L**ectures **A**s **S**ummaries_) is to serve as a guide and resource that gives you a quick overview of each lecture. For each lecture, there is:

*   a summary of the main topics covered,
*   the Why This Matters moment,
*   and the new Why This Employs section,
*   plus a few example problems with solutions.

The CHEMATLAS is organized into three Units, which reflects the content that goes into each of the three exams. There's also a Concept Map at the beginning of each Unit, to show how the various materials are connected together.

We created this to provide a clear snapshot of the materials covered in any given lecture, and it also gives me a chance to provide additional details that I may not have time for in the Why This Matters example, and also it lets me try out the Why This Employs section, which I certainly will not have time to discuss much in the lecture.

The lecture summaries in the CHEMATLAS are meant to be a companion for the lectures, not a substitute. If you were to only read these summaries you'd get a good sense of the lecture from a very high level view, but you wouldn't get enough out of it to learn the material in a meaningful way.
